# AKS Flex Node

## Overview

AKS Flex Node extends Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to customer-managed virtual machines and bare metal hosts, enabling them to run as AKS worker nodes outside standard AKS node pools. It is built on top of [Azure Unbounded](https://github.com/Azure/unbounded), which provides the host-side foundation for running and reconciling isolated Kubernetes node environments.

> **Status:** AKS Flex Node is currently alpha software.

## Key Features And Scenarios

- Bootstrap and join virtual machines or bare metal hosts for both amd64 and arm64 as AKS worker nodes.
- Support hybrid, lab, and specialized hardware scenarios.
- Use flexible authentication modes, including Azure Arc, managed identity (MSI), and Kubernetes bootstrap token.
- Automatically detect NVIDIA GPU devices and configure the container runtime for accelerated workloads.
- Run blue-green in-place updates and upgrades while retaining the existing host.
- Manage your Flex Node fleet through AKS management APIs for upgrade, repair, reset, and related lifecycle operations.
- Remediate and repair agent and node state through first-class lifecycle operations.

## Getting Started

This quickstart walks you through joining your first **Flex Node machine**, an on-premises physical server or virtual machine you own, to an existing AKS cluster, then running a workload on it. Plan about 10 minutes once the prerequisites are in place.

### Prerequisites

This quickstart involves two machines. Keep them distinct:

- **Your workstation** is the computer you drive the setup from, using the Azure CLI and `kubectl` (for example, your laptop). It is not joined to the cluster; it only generates the configuration and runs commands. Every step labeled **Run on: your workstation** happens here.
- **Your Flex Node machine** is the on-premises physical server or virtual machine you are joining to the cluster as a worker node. Every step labeled **Run on: your Flex Node machine** happens there.

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An Azure subscription. [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- **Your workstation**, with the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), `kubectl`, `curl`, and `python3` installed. Sign in with `az login`, then `az account set --subscription "<subscription-id>"`.
- **An existing AKS cluster** with a Linux node pool. Azure CNI is recommended so pods are reachable across your network, and you need permission to configure RBAC on the cluster. If you don't have a cluster yet, see [create an AKS cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-cli).
- **A Flex Node machine you own**: an on-premises physical server or a virtual machine to join as the worker node. It must:
  - run `systemd` and allow root installation,
  - have at least 4 vCPUs and enough memory for nspawn startup and the Kubernetes components,
  - be reachable from your workstation over SSH.

### Network requirements

Your Flex Node machine and the AKS cluster must be able to reach each other. Confirm each item before you start:

- **Outbound HTTPS (TCP 443)** from the Flex Node machine to the AKS API server.
- **Bidirectional reachability** between the Flex Node machine's private IP and the AKS node private IPs.
- **Non-overlapping CIDRs** between the host network and the cluster's node and pod address ranges.
- **NSG and firewall rules** that allow the CNI's cross-node traffic (typically TCP/UDP between node private IPs, and pod CIDR ranges depending on the CNI).
- **For private AKS clusters:** the Flex Node machine can resolve and reach the private API server endpoint.

> **Note**
> On-premises machines usually reach the cluster's private node network through a site-to-site VPN, ExpressRoute, or equivalent routed connectivity. Establishing that link is a prerequisite for this quickstart. For advanced network scenarios such as cross-region, gateway, or custom CNI topologies, follow the [lab guides](docs/labs/README.md).

### Step 1: Set your variables and connect to the cluster

**Run on: your workstation**

```bash
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<subscription-id>"
export RESOURCE_GROUP="<resource-group-of-your-aks-cluster>"
export CLUSTER_NAME="<cluster-name>"
export AGENT_POOL_NAME="${AGENT_POOL_NAME:-aksflexnodes}"

# Your Flex Node machine, as an SSH target (for example: azureuser@203.0.113.10)
export TARGET_HOST="<user>@<flex-node-machine-ip-or-hostname>"

az aks get-credentials --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" --name "$CLUSTER_NAME"
kubectl get nodes
```

You should see your existing cluster nodes in `Ready` state.

### Step 2: Generate the join configuration

**Run on: your workstation**

For a new VM, the released helper can combine controller setup, machine-goal publication, config generation, checksum verification, preflight, and startup into cloud-init or a shell payload. See [`prepare-node`](docs/usages/aks-flex-config.md#prepare-and-bootstrap-a-node). The steps below show the lower-level manual flow.

Download the helper, apply the node bootstrap RBAC bindings, and generate a bootstrap-token config from your cluster's metadata.

```bash
curl -fsSLo ./aks-flex-config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AKSFlexNode/main/scripts/aks-flex-config
chmod +x ./aks-flex-config

./aks-flex-config setup-node-rbac \
  --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --cluster-name "$CLUSTER_NAME" \
  --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION_ID"

./aks-flex-config generate-node-config \
  --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --cluster-name "$CLUSTER_NAME" \
  --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION_ID" \
  --agent-pool-name "$AGENT_POOL_NAME" \
  --bootstrap-token \
  --output ./aks-flex-node-config.json
```

This produces `aks-flex-node-config.json` in your current folder. `generate-node-config` supports one of the following auth modes: `--bootstrap-token`, `--identity`, `--service-principal --username <client-id> --password <client-secret>`, or `--arc`. This quickstart uses `--bootstrap-token`.

<details>
<summary>Example Config With Field Notes</summary>

The rendered config should look like this. Comments are shown here only to explain the fields; do not add comments to `/etc/aks-flex-node/config.json`.

```jsonc
{
  "azure": {
    "subscriptionId": "<subscription-id>", // Azure subscription that owns the AKS cluster.
    "tenantId": "<tenant-id>", // Microsoft Entra tenant for the subscription.
    "resourceManagerEndpoint": "https://management.azure.com", // Azure Resource Manager endpoint for ARM calls.
    "targetAgentPoolName": "<agent-pool-name>", // AKS agent pool used for FlexNode machine registration.
    "bootstrapToken": {
      "token": "<token-id>.<token-secret>" // Kubernetes bootstrap token created by generate-node-config.
    },
    "arc": { "enabled": false }, // Arc is disabled for this bootstrap-token flow.
    "targetCluster": {
      "resourceId": "<aks-resource-id>", // Full ARM resource ID of the AKS cluster.
      "location": "<aks-location>" // Azure region of the AKS cluster.
    }
  },
  "node": {
    "kubelet": {
      "clusterFQDN": "<aks-api-server-fqdn>", // AKS API server FQDN.
      "caCertData": "<base64-ca-data>" // Cluster CA bundle from kubeconfig.
    }
  },
  "networking": {
    "dnsServiceIP": "<cluster-dns-service-ip>" // Cluster DNS service IP from the AKS network profile.
  },
  "agent": {
    "logLevel": "info", // Agent log verbosity.
    "logDir": "/var/log/aks-flex-node" // Host log directory.
  },
  "components": { "kubernetes": "<aks-kubernetes-version>" } // Kubelet version to install.
}
```

</details>

### Step 3: Copy the configuration to your Flex Node machine

**Run on: your workstation**

```bash
scp ./aks-flex-node-config.json "$TARGET_HOST:/tmp/aks-flex-node-config.json"
```

> **Note**
> The config is staged in `/tmp` because your SSH user cannot write to root-owned `/etc`, and `/etc/aks-flex-node` does not exist yet. The next step creates that directory and installs the file as root with owner-only `0600` permissions.

### Step 4: Install the agent on your Flex Node machine

First, from your workstation, open an SSH session on the Flex Node machine.

**Run on: your workstation**

```bash
ssh "$TARGET_HOST"
```

You are now connected to the Flex Node machine. Install the agent and move the generated config into place, as root.

**Run on: your Flex Node machine**

```bash
sudo su
# Optional: set AKS_FLEX_NODE_VERSION=<release-tag> to install a specific release.
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AKSFlexNode/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
aks-flex-node version

install -d -m 0755 /etc/aks-flex-node
install -m 0600 /tmp/aks-flex-node-config.json /etc/aks-flex-node/config.json

cat /etc/aks-flex-node/config.json
```

### Step 5: Run preflight checks

**Run on: your Flex Node machine**

Preflight is non-mutating. It validates host prerequisites, API server reachability, rootfs image reachability, and bootstrap artifact sources before bootstrap changes the host.

```bash
aks-flex-node preflight --config /etc/aks-flex-node/config.json
```

Confirm all checks pass before continuing.

### Step 6: Join the node

**Run on: your Flex Node machine**

This installs the long-running agent service and starts the local Kubernetes worker environment.

```bash
umask 022
aks-flex-node start --config /etc/aks-flex-node/config.json
```

> **Note**
> `umask 022` sets standard default permissions (directories `755`, files `644`). The bootstrap creates the node's nspawn rootfs directories, and `755` lets non-root service users such as `dbus` traverse them; without it, the node fails to start. Your credentials are unaffected: the config file remains `0600`.

Confirm the agent is running:

```bash
systemctl is-active aks-flex-node-agent
journalctl -u aks-flex-node-agent -f
```

Example output:

```text
active
```

Example logs:

```text
Started aks-flex-node-agent.service - AKS Flex Node Agent.
aks-flex-node[3800]: level=INFO msg="running agent daemon" nodeName=aks-flex-config-test
aks-flex-node[3800]: level=INFO msg="machine state reconciled" status=healthy
```

When you are finished, press `Ctrl+C` to stop following the logs, then run `exit` twice, once to leave the root shell and once to close the SSH session, to return to your workstation.

### Step 7: Verify the node joined

**Run on: your workstation**

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

Example output:

```text
NAME                   STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION   INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE             KERNEL-VERSION      CONTAINER-RUNTIME
aks-flex-config-test   Ready    <none>   12s   v1.34.3   10.0.0.4      <none>        Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS   6.17.0-1013-azure   containerd://2.0.4
```

The node name matches the Flex Node machine's hostname unless you set `agent.nodeName` in the config. Schedule a test workload onto it to confirm it can run pods (replace `<node-name>` with the name shown above):

```bash
kubectl run hello --image=mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aks-helloworld:v1 \
  --overrides='{"spec":{"nodeName":"<node-name>"}}'
kubectl get pod hello -o wide
```

<details>
<summary>Inspect the nspawn worker (optional)</summary>

AKS Flex Node runs the Kubernetes worker inside a local nspawn machine. You can inspect it from the Flex Node machine:

```bash
machinectl list
machinectl status kube1
journalctl -M kube1 -u kubelet -f
journalctl -M kube1 -u containerd -f
```

Watch the kubelet and containerd logs to see how the nspawn-backed worker handles scheduled workloads.

</details>

### Clean up

Remove the test workload from your workstation:

```bash
kubectl delete pod hello --ignore-not-found
```

<details>
<summary>Reset And Uninstall</summary>

To remove AKS Flex Node from the host, run the uninstall script as root:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AKSFlexNode/main/scripts/uninstall.sh | bash -s -- --force
```

Example summary:

```text
SUCCESS: Reset completed
SUCCESS: Removed directory: /var/lib/aks-flex-node
SUCCESS: Removed binary: /usr/local/bin/aks-flex-node
SUCCESS: Azure CLI removed successfully
SUCCESS: AKS Flex Node uninstallation completed!
```

Example reset details:

```text
level=INFO msg="systemd service uninstalled" unit=aks-flex-node-agent.service
level=INFO msg="removing machine rootfs" machine=kube1 dir=/var/lib/machines/kube1
level=INFO msg="removed runtime directory" path=/etc/aks-flex-node
level=INFO msg="removed runtime directory" path=/var/log/aks-flex-node
```

After uninstall, the host should no longer have the agent service or nspawn machines:

```bash
systemctl is-active aks-flex-node-agent
machinectl list
```

Example output:

```text
inactive
No machines.
```

Finally, remove the Kubernetes `Node` object from your workstation:

```bash
kubectl delete node <node-name>
```
